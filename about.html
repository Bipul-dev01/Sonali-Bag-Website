    <h3>Teaching experience in Bangladesh</h3>
    <p>Mubarak Ahmed Khan has been a faculty member at institutions like Mirzapur College(1982-1984), Shahjalal University of Science and Technology (1991-2002), Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University(2010-2016) and from 2012 to present is an adjunct professor of the University of Dhaka.

    He is also a visiting professor of Daffodil International University and Islamic University of Technology, Bangladesh. He has supervised more than 300 M.Sc. students, 8 M. Ph. students and 20 Ph.D. students.</p>

    <h3>Membership</h3>
    <p>Mubarak Ahmad Khan is former a member of IUPAC polymer division and New York Academy of Science. He is a member of Bangladesh Chemical Society, Bangladesh Physical Society, Bangladesh Association for the Advance of Science, Association of Humboldt Fellows Bangladesh. He is member of section committee (Associate professor and professor level) of Jahangirnagar University. He is convener member of Syllabus/ Curriculum committee on polymer and material science of various universities of Bangladesh.</p>

   <h1 class="mt-5 mb-4">Scientific career</h1>
   <p>Mubarak Ahmad Khan work on environmental science, material science, health care, agriculture and biological science. He is working on sustainable material and also working on nano-technology. He has invented biodegradable polybag (Sonali Bag) from jute fibre to remove plastic pollution.He work on deafferents type of composite materials, in this continuing he has invented Jute Reinforcement Corrugated Sheet (Commercial name is Jutin). He used to mix jute with polymer for the making of Jutin. He invented advance wound dressing material from cow bone, biodegradable PPE from jute with chitosan, biodegradable sanitary napkin from jute based superabsorbent, Natural Dye Sensitized Solar Cell. He has invented natural plant growth promoter from prawn shell, liquate biofertilizer from textile effluent etc. In 2016 he created non-harmful proteins as an alternative to harmful formalin for human body. He also invented numerous essential things with jute.</p>


   <h3>Biodegradable polybag (Sonali Bag)</h3>
   <p>The Sonali Bag is a cellulose-based biodegradable bioplastic alternative to plastic bags, particularly polythene bags. The cellulose used in Sonali Bags is extracted from jute, a major vegetable fiber crop grown across the globe. "Sonali Bag" which name had provided by Bangladesh Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2017. The Sonali Bag (biopolymer) is made of natural ingredients like jute based cellulose, binder ( a natural polymer), and vegetable color. This is a biopolymer without any plastic. So, the preparation method and instrument of the biopolymer is different then that traditional plastic.</p>

   <h3>Positive effect on environment of sonali bag</h3>
   <p>Polyolefins like polyethylene, polypropylene are hydrocarbon hydrophobic polymers, resistant to peroxidation, biodegradation, highly resistant to hydrolysis, which is their main attribute in packaging, and not biodegradable. Nowadays their use has to be restricted and banned because they are not totally recyclable, biodegradable, compostable and eco-friendly so they pose serious ecological problems, toxic substance, contaminated foods and biological substance and serious health hazard and diseases. The main aim of biodegradable, compostable, recyclable and environmental friendly packaging material is to imitate the life cycle of biomass, which includes conservation of fossil resources, water, and CO2 production. The speed of biodegradation depends on temperature (50 to 70C), humidity, number and type of microbes. Biodegradable packaging materials are converted into biomass, water, and CO2 in about 180 day. On the other hand, Sonali Bag is made from natural resources i.e., jute cellulose. It is designed to degrade upon disposal by the action of living organisms. So it is 100% biodegradable, compostable, recyclable and eco-friendly, it decomposes in the soil within 3–4 months and increases the soil fertility. This bag produces biomass e.g., CO2, H2O etc. when it is buried as landfill. The production process is also suitable for the environment because all kinds of chemicals are nontoxic which are used during the production process and there is no smoke or fume produce during processing. It becomes ash when it burn, produces only carbon molecules. The roots of plants can easily penetrate into the bag during landfill, and there is no harmful effect on seed germination. The biodegradable packaging materials of Sonali Bag start to dissolve in water after 5 hours and formed into biological foods. Cellulose is renewable like carbon dioxide, water and sunshine. It is biodegradable; eco- friendly and cheap. It is very easy to modify it chemically and physically. The source of raw materials of cellulose is abundant in Bangladesh. So it is unnecessary to rely on petroleum to prepare polymer. People may raise this polymer by planting trees on earth, so the environmental problems will be no longer as severe as today. At present and near future, Sonali bag will bring the golden age in Bangladesh.</p>


   <h3>Sonali Bag with UN SDGs goal</h3>
   <p>Sonali Bag can contribute in seven UN SDGs goal.These 7 SDGs goal are-

    SDG 3: Good health and well-being.
    SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation.
    SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities.
    SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production.
    SDG 13: Climate action.
    SDG 14: Life below water (protection of the seas and oceans).
    SDG 15: Life on land (restore ecosystems and preserve diversity).</p>

    <h3>Jute reinforced polymer corrugated sheet (Jutin)</h3>
    <p>Jutin is a low cost and durable housing material. Jutin is a lightweight, ultra-strong, corrugated, and sustainable jute reinforced polymer composite. It is rustproof, soundproof, and saline water-resistance. Its low thermal conductivity provides more comfort in both summer and winter. Now Jutin is being manufactured in Khan's laboratory manually but a pilot-scale production facility is under construction collaborating with a private entrepreneur.</p>

    <h3>Publication</h3>
    <p>The world's various scientific research organizations publish documents on his work. In 1998, his name was published in the publication of 'Who's Who'.[4] His publication list more than 800 and 20 book chapters. He has three research patents.</p>

    <h3>Awards and honors</h3>
    <p>In recognition of his success in research on jute, Bangladesh Academy of Sciences gave the gold medal in 2010 to Mubarak Ahmed.Apart from this, he was awarded the National Jute Award in 2016, the Federation of Asian Chemical Society Award in 2017,[4] National Environment Awards in 2019, MIT Solve Health Security & Pandemic Awards(2020).</p>
